<p>Ragnar is a tool designed to help identify the gaps in student mathematics skills and provide targeted feedback. By leveraging student test score data, Ragnar uses a machine learning algorithm to make a 'best guess' on the skill levels for each student. Skill-based feedback is then provided to students and teachers to aid improvement.</p>

 <h3>Features:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-existing Data Sources</strong>: Processes student test score data from QLAs which are well-established in education.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimisation</strong>: Uses an Expectation Maximisation algorithm to optimise predictions on student skill levels.</li>
        <li><strong>User-friendly Feedback</strong>: Delivers feedback to teachers and students using the RAG (Red, Amber, Green) system.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactivity</strong>: Allows users to change the feedback method, harshness, and choose whether to cluster students into skills-based groups. </li>
    </ul>
