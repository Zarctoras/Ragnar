<p>Ragnar is a precision education tool that identifies student knowledge gaps in mathematics whilst integrating seamlessly into the teacher's toolkit. It aims to streamline skill assessment in education, providing teachers with clear, data-backed insights into student performance and offering students personalised feedback for improvement.</p>

 <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-existing Data Sources</strong>: Processes student test score data from QLAs which are well-established in education.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimisation</strong>: Uses an expectation-maximisation algorithm to optimise predictions on student skill levels.</li>
        <li><strong>User-friendly Feedback</strong>: Delivers feedback to teachers and students using the RAG (Red/Amber/Green) system.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactivity</strong>: Allows users to change the feedback method, harshness, and choose whether to cluster students into skills-based groups. </li>
    </ul>

<p><strong>Why Ragnar?</strong></p>
<p>Skills can be viewed as the building blocks of mathematics ability. A single weak skill can prevent a student from answering a question correctly or mastering a new concept. Working as an interventionist in secondary education, I witnessed how much effort goes into filling these knowledge gaps. Ragnar streamlines this process by shining a light on these gaps. By using Ragnar, educators can focus on targeted interventions and deliver personalised feedback to their students.</p>
