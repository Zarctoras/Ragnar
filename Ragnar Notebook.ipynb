    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When I began as an interventionist in a busy secondary school maths department, a particular statement stuck with me. \"It's really about each of their skills\" a teacher remarked as we discussed a strategy for me to best support his class of Year 11s. Over time, I came to appreciate this insight and embedded it into my approach to effectively support students who had managed to slip through the cracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this perspective, skills are at the heart of one's education in mathematics. Think about where we start: learning foundational skills such as addition and division. Once these are mastered, we utilise them in learning new skills such as adding fractions, and this process continues. Think about where we end: anxiously answering questions in the final exam. These questions test our mathematics skills and often a few at a time. Skills constitute our mathematics ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, skills must also be at the centre of underachievement. Take a student who is struggling to get their head around a concept or a question. It could be a single skill which creates the gap between knowing and not knowing. Every student will have contended with these gaps; and educators work tirelessly to fill them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifying and facilitating this challenge, Ragnar illuminates these gaps *by*:\n",
    "* Utilising potentially vast diagnostic mathematics test score data\n",
    "* Optimising a statistical model using an Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "*In order to:*\n",
    "* Predict the most likely levels of skills for each student\n",
    "* Present comprehensible overviews to teachers/departments regarding these skills\n",
    "* Provide constructive skills-based feedback to students\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "*Ragnar is a name from Old Norse origin meaning \"warrior\" - how one could picture a student in their own right - and \"judgement,\" which is the point of the model - to effectively judge test scores. In this case, Ragnar primarily comes from the acronym \"RAG,\" frequently used in education to describe a process of providing feedback to students.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Note to the reader: To streamline the notebook I cut out the bulk of the derivations and code for this EM algorithm however, if you're like me and *love* getting down to the nitty gritty, please refer to the appendix and the source code (kaggle input) respectively. One last thing - this is my first Kaggle submission so I appreciate all feedback!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "At least in the British secondary education system, Question-Level Analysis (QLA) is an established way of collecting student test data. A QLA is a spreadsheet where, once they finish marking a test, a teacher inputs the number of marks achieved for each question for each student. It is common practice for QLAs to include simple summary measures for questions, such as an average mark, and students, like total marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, a simple QLA was used to collect the score data for a test I gave to a class of year 10 students (yes, they suffered for you). Below I present this QLA (note that the scores have been anonymised). The columns contain scores for each question (broken down into their parts where applicable) and each row contains the scores for each student (Alpha, Bravo, ...). I also include the final row which denotes the total marks avaiable for each question. This is as standard as a QLA gets."

    "Skills are latent (not directly observable) variables. However, from how a student performs in a test, we can get a picture of what these skills might look like. For instance, if a student is systematically failing questions using Pythagoras' Theorem, we can infer they are weak in this skill. In essence, Ragnar treats each mark as a signal and deals with each of these signals in an optimal way to return a 'best guess' on student skills. In the remainder of this section, the QLA is transformed so that this process can take place.\n",

    "To eventually infer a student's skill levels from these marks, we must firstly define what a skill is. A skill in this context is a resource a student draws upon to take the next step in answering a question correctly. For example, in order to calculate the longest side of a right-angled triangle given the two shorter sides, an individual must firstly understand Pythagoras' Theorem, be able to substitute into the formula, and then algebraically solve for the answer. Each step requires its own skill and each skill may contain their own skills depending on our level of detail. Given a level of detail, I define skill $k$ as a variable between zero and one:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y^k \\in[0,1]\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_i = (Yi^1,...,Y_i^K)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ragnar considers an underlying model for the achievement of each mark. For any mark $j$ (with score $X_j$), each skill must be above a certain threshold for an individual to be *competent* which, in theory, means they score correctly ($X_j=1$ rather than $0$). Our theoretical model for $X_j$ is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "X_{ij} & = \\prod_k1(Y_i^k\\geq T^k_j)\\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $1(\\cdot)$ is a standard indicator function and $T^k_j$ are our thresholds for each skill. The function reflects our measure of competency defined earlier: If all skills are above the threshold then each indicator function is equal to one and so their product will equal one. This implies the student is competent so they achieve the mark. Note that functional form can also include skills not used in mark $j$ by simply setting $T^k_j=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a perfect world, our model is absolute. Our thresholds are set perfectly and getting a mark right or wrong is completly determined by this underlying model. If an individual gets a mark correct, we can be certain their skills lie above the thresholds and take this as a given.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Less Perfect World\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, the underlying model and actual outcomes will not align perfectly. In fact, the model might be a really poor way of describing reality. This is for two broad reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Alternative Explanations:** The model is not absolute. There are a plethora of other reasons as to why a student may or may not pick up a mark. An obvious one is that people make mistakes. Secondly, skills might operate differently to the model assumes. For instance, despite a skill being below the threshold, a different stronger skill may make up for this and allow the student to get the mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inaccurate Model Building:** Threshold parameters are preset by a human model builder in this setup. Whilst it's expected the model builder knows something about gauging difficulties of skills used in a mark, they are will have their own biases and inaccuracies. As such, our measure of competency for each mark won't be perfect.\n",

    "Before discussing the mathematical implications, I provide a method for the model builder to set the skills and thresholds for each mark. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each skill corresponds an integer key and each threshold lies between 0 and 1, reflecting the difficulty of using the skill in the context of the mark. The model builder can use the following data frame for this."

    "### The Augmented Model\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have discussed, the model is not a perfect representation of the process underlying a student's success in a mark. Therefore, an error term $u_{ij}$ that accounts for this discrepancy is introduced. $u_{ij}$ effectively dictates whether or not our measure of competency for mark $j$ is mirrored in its score $X_{ij}$. The augmented model is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_{ij} = \\prod_k1(Y_i^k\\geq T^k_j) + u_{ij}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the following assumptions are made:\n",
    "1. The prior distribution over $Y^k\\in[0,1]$ is continuous and uniform for all $k$ and individuals $i$\n",
    "2. For a given mark $j$, the error terms $u_{ij}$ for each $i$ are independently and identically distributed according to parameter $\\theta_j$ such that $\\theta_j = P\\left(u_{ij}=0\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption one tells us that, prior to using the signals to update our beliefs on skills, there is no \"best guess\" for a skill $Y_i^k$ given it has a flat probability distribution. The second assumption implies $\\theta_j$ represents the quality of our measure of competency. It is the probability that our measure of competency for mark $j$ and the score $X_{ij}$ are in agreement since $\\theta_j = P\\left(u_{ij}=0\\right) = P\\left(X_{ij}=\\prod_k1(Y_i^k\\geq T^k_j)\\right)$ *(See the appendix for a more rigorous definition)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Estimation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a distribution on $u_{ij}$ parametrised by $\\theta_j$, yielding a probablistic interpretation of each signal. Combined with the assumed prior distribution on each $Y^k$, we can update our beliefs on student skills using a Bayesian framework. This section is concerned with doing so optimally using the Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Belief Updating\n",
    "\n",
    "To utilise the EM algorithm, we need a framework for updating skills based on our signal given our parameters $\\theta$. Firstly, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X_{ij}=1|Y_i) = \\prod_k1(Y_i^k\\geq T^k_j)\\times \\theta_j+\\left(1-\\prod_k1(Y_i^k\\geq T^k_j)\\right)\\times (1-\\theta_j)$$\n",
    "$$P(X_{ij}=0|Y_i) = \\prod_k1(Y_i^k\\geq T^k_j)\\times (1-\\theta_j)+\\left(1-\\prod_k1(Y_i^k\\geq T^k_j)\\right)\\times \\theta_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As the probability of our observed variable conditional on our unobserved variable, these two equations provide us with our first step in updating. Consider the first. It states that if $Y_i$ is such that $i$ is competent for $j$ then the probability we see a correct score is $\\theta_j$. On the other hand, if $i$ is not competent for $j$ then the probability becomes $1-\\theta_j$. Therefore, notice this conditional probability depends on $\\theta_j$ so we can write it as $P(X_{ij}=1|Y_i, \\theta_j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since error terms are assumed uncorrelated within $i$, we can write the overall conditional probability of seeing all scores as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X_i|Y_i,\\theta) = \\prod_jP(X_{ij} | Y_i, \\theta_j)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an observation of a set of signals, we can update the skills using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y_i|X_i, \\theta_j) = \\frac{\\prod_jP(X_{ij}|Y_i,\\theta_j)P(Y_i)}{P(X_i| \\theta)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $P(Y_i)$ uses the prior distribution on $Y_i$ which is assumed as uniform across the domain $[0,1]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The denominator of this fraction, $P(X_i|\\theta)$, can be viewed as the likelihood of seeing $i$'s scores. Combined with the assumption scores are independent across $i$, our overall likelihood of the observed scores for all $i$ can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L(\\theta;X) = P(X|\\theta) =\\prod_i\\left(\\sum_{Y_i}\\left[\\prod_jP(X_{ij}|Y_i,\\theta_j)\\right]P(Y_i)\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimal Beliefs: EM Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the likelihood is a function of $\\theta$, we can decide a best way to set this parameter. An obvious way is to choose the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimates. In other words, we want the $\\theta$ that produces the observed scores with the greatest likelihood. Our problem is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\max_{\\theta} \\prod_i\\left(\\sum_{Y_i}\\left[\\prod_jP(X_{ij}|Y_i,\\theta_j)\\right]P(Y_i)\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A common measure to simplify such a problem is to take logs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\max_{\\theta}\\sum_ilog\\sum_{Y_i}\\left[\\prod_jP(X_{ij}|Y_i,\\theta_j)\\right]P(Y_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would take first (and maybe second) derivatives to find a $\\theta$ that maximises this function. However, this is made tricky by the $log\\sum_{Y_i}()$ above. A work around for this is the Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm which is commonly used for latent variable problems such as this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EM algorithm accepts that this log likelihood function is difficult to optimise directly. Instead, it finds a lower bound for this function that is easier to optimise. This lower bound is pinned down by an initial parameter value $\\theta_t$ and it is then optimised with respect to $\\theta$ to find a new value $\\theta_{t+1}$. The process until we approach an optimum which is visually demonstrated below."

Define a skill combination as $Y=\\{Y^1,Y^2,Y^3,Y^4,Y^5\\}$ where $Y^k$ is a given bin for skill $k$. Find every possible combination of these bins and assign a prior probability to each of these skill combinations.\n",

Looking at each of marks, I calculate for each skill the probability that it was this skill that held the student back from being competent for the mark. Then, I collapse these down to their means, calling this statisting *Lim*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are two ways to do this. Firstly, in calculating the mean for each skill, one could include the marks where that skill is not used and here the probability of this skill preventing the student from getting the mark is zero. Therefore, less frequently used skills wont be presented as important. This might be a good thing since we want student to work on the skills which will have a greater impact on their test scores. On the other hand, one could exclude the marks where skills are not used in the interest of an unbiased persperctive on each skill. The better method depends on who's deciding and is selected with the *mode* parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in the interest of not producing overwhelmingly positive or negative feedback, we may want to scale these values. We do this here with a log transformation where the base is impacted by the parameter *scale* (in fact, scale sets the log base to fix an average scaled lim)."

    "A potentially useful angle would be to cluster the students based on their strengths and weaknesses. That way, a teacher can tailor the support they provide quite simply. For example if there is a group of students who excel at all skills except from a specific skill, then a teacher can provide work to these students emphasising that one skill. In my role as an interventionist, such a tool would be exceedingly useful to provide targeted support efficiently. It would not only tell me which students have fallen through any cracks, but also the specific cracks a student has fallen through.\n",

In this system, something marked as <span style=\"color:green\">green</span> tells a student that they are making good progress in this area and/or are performing well. Alternatively, something marked <span style=\"color:red\">red</span> highlights this area as something that needs to be worked on.\n",

This bypasses overly negative feedback where a student is told all of their skills are weak.

In my opinion, this form of feedback is motivational and emulates commonly used methods such as 'two stars and a wish' where students are provided with their strengths and weaknesses.\n",

Finally, I display a simple table of scores for each question thus providing a rough-and-ready indication of performance."

    "# Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "One point of concern is the test's diagnostic design. In this context, the mark scheme was constructed so that question-level scores were indicative of marks. This way of marking is uncommon. At least in the British education system, maths exams are generally summaitve. For example, a student may drop the first mark of a question but recover some marks due to correct working. This system seems fair where total marks are used a vague indication of ability. However, Ragnar currently rejects this type of marking because each mark needs to have a distinct identity. \n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, Ragnar's framework does not reject an extension that accounts for a more obscure way of marking. One could, for example, expand the probablistic model for how an individual can get two out of three marks in a question and, from here, we could estimate the model and infer skills accordingly as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second limitation is the partially human element where the skills and thresholds are set. This process is arbitrary and depends on how an individual percieves skills as well as their difficulties. With enough data, the impact of one poorly defined question should be limited due to our optimisation method. However, imagine if every question was poorly defined. The model couldn't distinguish between good and bad signals, and would probably overfit, providing incorrect inferences on skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this, it can also be seen as a redeeming characteristic since Ragnar's aim is to provide actionable feedback. If predictive accuracy were the objective then optimising skills and thresholds might be the right move. Whilst such an algorithm could provide the most likely categorisations for questions, it couldn't tell you what those categories are without at least some supervision. Like most tools, Ragnar is only as good as the teacher it supports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "A promising alternative method to a QLA for data collection is the use of educational technologies. Since Ragnar relies on question score data, it can certainly be used where these technologies test students. As their capacity to accurately mark student work expands, the more we can trust the score data they provide, and the better Ragnar will perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various ways the feedback provided to students can be augmented. A natural extension would be to give students questions tailored to their scores and skills. For example, in the case that a student struggles with a specific skill, we could provide them with questions that use this skill as well as skills that the student is likely competent with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often schools will have multiple sources of information on student scores, such as different assessments or a hybrid of digital and paper-based testing. The issue in utilising all of this data is that each source reflects a different snapshot of student abilities since this will change over time. The problem here is how we treat these various sources to provide correct insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, one extension makes the most sense: the Baum-Welch algorithm. It is a natural extension of the EM algorithm that models the evolution of skills as a markov chain. This would allow us to treat different sources of information as different whilst still making the most of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, we can not only infer a student's current skills but also their skills at different points in time. This information may be useful in understanding how different students learn, for example which skills are important to learning a new one or how this may differ between students. Subsequently, this could be used to drive improvements in a curriculum or teaching methods.\n",
